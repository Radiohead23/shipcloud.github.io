# Libraries

## shipcloud-ruby

We've written a shipcloud wrapper for the ruby language that you can use for integrating shipcloud
into your own ruby projects. Just head over to our [Github repository](//github.com/shipcloud/shipcloud-ruby),
clone it and off you go!

## shipcloud-php

You can find a shipcloud wrapper for PHP at [github.com/comyo-media/shipcloud-php](//github.com/comyo-media/shipcloud-php).
It is maintained by [comyo-media](http://comyo.media/).

## Integrations wanted!

You're developing for a platform that we're missing? Great! We're always looking for new partners
who'd like to integrate us into their platform or the platform they're using. Feel free to contact
us so we can put up links to your work on our sites once the integration is available.

__Notice:__ To make things easier for our support team we'd kindly ask you to send a custom header
with every request you're making. This way we can identify problems with a specific platform easier.
The headers key is '__Affiliate-ID__'. To know which value you need to specify, please contact us at
developers@shipcloud.io.
