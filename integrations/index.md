# Libraries

## shipcloud-ruby

We've written a shipcloud wrapper for the ruby language that you can use for integrating shipcloud
into your own ruby projects. Just head over to our [Github repository](//github.com/shipcloud/shipcloud-ruby),
clone it and off you go!

# Plugins / Extensions / Modules

Why reinvent the wheel? There are already a lot of plugins / extensions / modules / libraries for
existing services or coding languages available. So maybe you won't have to write your own code for
integrating shipcloud into your system. Just have a look at
[our integrations page](https://www.shipcloud.io/en/integrations/plugins?utm_source=devportal) and
see for yourself.

## Integrations wanted!

You're developing for a platform that we're missing? Great! We're always looking for new partners
who'd like to integrate us into their platform or the platform they're using. Feel free to contact
us so we can put up links to your work on our sites once the integration is available.

__Notice:__ To make things easier for our support team we'd kindly ask you to send a custom header
with every request you're making. This way we can identify problems with a specific platform easier.
The headers key is '__Affiliate-ID__'. To know which value you need to specify, please contact us at
developers@shipcloud.io.
